              The Maitre D queue management system is designed to allow your
              customers to sign up for walk-in appointments and select the
              services they want ahead of time. The queue will provide them with
              estimated wait times, costs and will allow them to even select
              their preferred stylist.
            </p>
            <p className="Color-black Ff-worksans Fs-sm3 Font-style-normal Fw-400 Line-height-154 Opacity70 Max-w-484 Mb-25">
              As the queue gets bigger or smaller, its easy to monitor your
              operations and understand when wait periods are getting too long
              to service your customer base and to better resource your stores
              during busy periods. Beat the frustration of your customers ahead
              of time and help manage how they wait for your services
